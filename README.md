# Classification

Here you will find some of my work in data analysis using Python.

Specifically, these are exercises based on the [Stellar Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17?resource=download) hosted on Kaggle.

I utilized Logit, LDA, QDA, Na√Øve Bayes, and KNN models to predict whether celestial bodies were galaxies, quasars, or stars based on spectral characteristics.
